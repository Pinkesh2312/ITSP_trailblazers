# ITSP_trailblazers
This repository is created for ease in collaboration for ITSP project.    

Project: the main objective of this project is to make a python code which extracts all the mails from IITB's webmail and classifies them as important or not important and we further intend to classify these mails in different categories. Then we plan to send these mails over telegram using a telegram bot.   

All those who are collaborating in this project are requested to pull this repo and modify this readme file whenever they make any changes to the repo.
--------------extract_final.py ------------   
    This file is supposed to contains the code for logging into webmail using selenium and then extract all the unread mails and store their sender's name, subject and body seperately and then logs out of webmail.
    Till now, a major portion of this code is completed, a basic body string along with name and subject is obtained on running the code.
